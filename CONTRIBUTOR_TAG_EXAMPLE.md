## ‚ùå Common Mistakes (DON'T DO THIS!)

### ‚ùå Wrong: Using Placeholder Text

```markdown
# My Project
**Contributor:** YourUsername
```

**Problem:** "YourUsername" is a placeholder, not your actual GitHub username!

### ‚ùå Wrong: Missing Contributor Tag

```markdown
# My Project

## Description
This is my awesome project.
```

**Problem:** No contributor tag at all - you won't appear on the leaderboard!

### ‚ùå Wrong: Wrong Format

```markdown
# My Project
Contributor: john-doe
```

**Problem:** Missing the bold markdown (`**`). While this might work, use the correct format to be safe.

### ‚ùå Wrong: Tag Not at the Start

```markdown
# My Project

## Description
This is my project.

## Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

**Contributor:** john-doe
```

**Problem:** Contributor tag should be at the START of your README, right after the title!

---

## ‚úÖ The Perfect Format

```markdown
# [Your Project Title]
**Contributor:** your-actual-github-username

## Description
[Rest of your README content...]
```

## üîç Quick Checklist

Before submitting your PR, verify:

- [ ] ‚úÖ Added `**Contributor:** username` line
- [ ] ‚úÖ Used my **actual** GitHub username (not "YourUsername" or placeholder)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Placed it at the **start** of the README, right after the title
- [ ] ‚úÖ Used correct format with double asterisks (`**`)
- [ ] ‚úÖ My username matches my GitHub profile exactly (case-sensitive!)

## üéØ Where to Add This?

Add the contributor tag in **YOUR PROJECT'S README.md** file:

```
Domains/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [YourDomain]/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MiniProjects/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YourProjectName/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md  üëà Add your contributor tag HERE!
```

**Example Path:**
```
Domains/Frontend/MiniProjects/TodoApp/README.md
```

**NOT** in the main repository README.md!

---

## üß™ How to Test

After adding your contributor tag, you can test locally:

```bash
cd ProjectHive
node scripts/testLeaderboard.js
```

This will scan all files and show if your username was detected correctly.

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If you've added the contributor tag but still don't appear on the leaderboard:

1. **Check your username spelling** - It must match your GitHub profile exactly
2. **Check the format** - Use `**Contributor:** username` (with double asterisks)
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** after PR merge - The automation takes a moment to run
4. **Check Actions tab** - Look for any errors in the workflow
5. **Ask for help** - Open an issue or discussion
