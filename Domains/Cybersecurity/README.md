## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Ethical Mindset**: Always get written permission before testing
2. **Documentation**: Document your methodology and findings
3. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities responsibly
4. **Safe Testing**: Use isolated environments (VMs, containers)
5. **Keep Learning**: Stay updated with latest threats and defenses
6. **Legal Awareness**: Understand cybersecurity laws in your region
7. **Defense First**: Focus on defensive security, not just offensive
8. **Privacy**: Protect sensitive data discovered during testing
