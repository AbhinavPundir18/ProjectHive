# Fetch-Style Promise Simulator

A web-based simulator that mimics real API fetch calls using JavaScript Promises. It demonstrates asynchronous programming concepts with a 20% simulated failure rate to practice error handling with .then() and .catch().

## Tech Stack

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Features

- Simulates API calls with 2-second delays
- 20% random failure rate for error handling practice
- Real-time success/failure statistics
- Modern, responsive UI

## How to Use

1. Enter an API endpoint URL
2. Select HTTP method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
3. Click "Make Request"
4. Watch the promise resolve or reject!

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding Promises (resolve, reject)
- Using setTimeout for async operations
- Error handling with try/catch and .catch()
- Async/await vs .then() patterns

## Installation

Just open `index.html` in your browser!
