📝 Description

NewsFlash is a responsive and modern web application that delivers the latest news headlines from multiple categories in real-time using the NewsAPI.

The project has a clean glassmorphism-inspired interface with smooth hover effects, animated loading transitions, and a seamless infinite scroll experience.
Users can explore top news, search for specific topics, and filter articles by categories like Technology, Sports, Business, Entertainment, and more.

Each news card contains a thumbnail, headline, short description, source, and a “Read More” button that opens the full article in a new tab.
