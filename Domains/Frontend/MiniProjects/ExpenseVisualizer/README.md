## 💻 Code Highlights

### Expense Data Structure

```javascript
const expense = {
    id: Date.now(),
    description: "Groceries",
    amount: 85.50,
    category: "food",
    date: "2024-01-15",
    notes: "Weekly grocery shopping",
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
};

Chart.js Integration

// Real-time chart updates
updateCharts(expenses) {
    const categoryData = this.getCategoryData(expenses);
    this.charts.category.data.labels = categoryData.labels;
    this.charts.category.data.datasets[0].data = categoryData.amounts;
    this.charts.category.update();
}

Advanced Filtering System

applyTimeFilter(expenses) {
    switch (this.currentFilter) {
        case 'today':
            const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
            return expenses.filter(expense => expense.date === today);
        case 'month':
            const monthStart = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), 1);
            return expenses.filter(expense => new Date(expense.date) >= monthStart);
        // ... more filters
    }
}

LocalStorage Management

saveExpenses() {
    localStorage.setItem('expenseVisualizer', JSON.stringify(this.expenses));
}

loadExpenses() {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('expenseVisualizer');
    if (saved) {
        this.expenses = JSON.parse(saved);
    }
}
