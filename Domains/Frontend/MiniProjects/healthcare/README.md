üè• Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

This is an interactive, multi-page web application built with Streamlit, Plotly, and Pandas for analyzing synthetic healthcare data. It provides a high-level overview of hospital performance, patient demographics, and cost analysis, all through a clean, tabbed interface.

This dashboard is designed to showcase how to build a modern, interactive analytics tool in Python without requiring a front-end framework.

üöÄ Features

Multi-Page Navigation: A clean sidebar allows users to navigate between four distinct pages:

Overview & Admissions: Tracks high-level KPIs (Total Patients, Avg. Stay, Recovery Rate) and visualizes admission trends over time.

Cost & Performance Analysis: Explores the financial aspects, including cost distribution by department and a dynamic scatter plot to find correlations.

Patient Demographics: Analyzes patient data by age, gender, and disease.

Patient Deep Dive: Allows the user to select a single patient (from the filtered list) to see their individual record and compare their stats against department averages.

Interactive Filtering: A powerful sidebar filtering system (organized with tabs) allows users to drill down into the data by:

Department

Doctor

Patient Outcome

Gender

Admission Date Range

Dynamic Visualizations: All charts are built with Plotly for interactivity (hover, zoom, pan). Key charts include:

Line charts for admission trends

Interactive pie charts for outcome distribution

Bar charts for department/disease analysis

Box plots to identify cost outliers

A dynamic scatter plot with selectable X/Y axes

A correlation heatmap with value labels

Custom CSS Styling: Injects custom CSS to override default Streamlit styles, providing a more professional and cohesive design (e.g., custom blue multiselect tags instead of the default red).

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

Python: Core language

Streamlit: For the web app framework, UI, and interactivity

Pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation

NumPy: For data generation and numerical operations

Plotly & Plotly Express: For all interactive data visualizations
