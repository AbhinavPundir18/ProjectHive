# AI-ML Roadmap
Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced

This roadmap is a suggested plan for learning Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning skills, including specific topics and areas of interest that can have separate files added to expand on in this folder. 


## Beginner: Foundation Skills

### Goal 
Learn the basics of machine learning and AI, building confidence in the use of Python coding skills, basic data analysis, and visualization skills

### Topics
- Python Fundamentals: focus on basic Python syntax, variables, loops, functions, NumPy
- Pandas Library: importing and cleaning data
- Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Machine Learning: basics of supervised and unsupervised learning, model basics
- Model Training: test/train split, linear regression, logistic regression
- Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix

## Intermediate: Applied Machine Learning

### Goal
Move beyond basic skills into model performance and testing, and engineering skills. 

### Topics
- Feature Engineering: scaling, domain knowledge
- Pipelines and Cross-Validation: `Pipeline`, `GridSearchCV`
- Model Comparison: Random Forest, SVM, KNN
- Data Leakage and Validation: prevent overfitting and leakage traps
- Deep Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Advanced: Production and Responsible AI

### Goal
Building competency with deploying, monitoring and scaling machine learning systems, with an understanding of ethics.

### Topics
- Model Deployment
- MLOps Concepts: CI/CD, versioning
- Bias: identify and mitigate bias in models
- Privacy and Governance: secure data handling
