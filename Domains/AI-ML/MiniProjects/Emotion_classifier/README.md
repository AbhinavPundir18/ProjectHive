# üé≠ Real-Time Emotion Detection using DeepFace and OpenCV

This project detects human emotions in real-time using a webcam feed.  
It utilizes the **DeepFace** library for emotion analysis and **OpenCV** for face detection and visualization.

## üöÄ Features

- Detects emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **surprise**, **neutral**, and more.  
- Works in **real-time** using your webcam.  
- Displays bounding boxes and emotion labels on detected faces.  
- Gracefully handles frames without detectable faces.
