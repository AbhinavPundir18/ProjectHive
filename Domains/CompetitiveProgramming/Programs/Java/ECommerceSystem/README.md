# E-Commerce Cart System

This is a simple, command-line Java application that simulates a basic e-commerce shopping cart. It allows a user to input multiple products, their prices, and quantities, and then calculates the subtotal, applies a conditional discount, and generates a final invoice.

## Features

* **Dynamic Product Entry:** Add any number of products to the cart.
* **Item Details:** Specify the name, price, and quantity for each product.
* **Subtotal Calculation:** Automatically sums the total cost of all items in the cart.
* **Discount Logic:** Applies a 10% discount if the subtotal is greater than $5,999.
* **Formatted Invoice:** Prints a clear, well-formatted invoice to the console, showing all items, the subtotal, the discount amount, and the final total.
