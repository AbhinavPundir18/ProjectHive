📋 Description

This is a Simple Quiz App built using Python.
It asks the user multiple-choice questions, takes their input (A/B/C/D), and calculates the final score at the end.
It’s a perfect beginner-friendly project to practice loops, conditionals, and lists/dictionaries in Python.

🚀 Features

✅ Multiple-choice questions
✅ Instant feedback (Correct/Wrong)
✅ Score counter
✅ Easy to modify or expand with new questions

🧩 How It Works

The quiz questions are stored in a list of dictionaries.

Each question dictionary includes:

"question" → the question text

"options" → list of answer choices

"answer" → correct option (A, B, C, or D)

The program displays one question at a time.

The user inputs their answer.

The app checks if the answer is correct and keeps track of the score.

At the end, it shows your total score.
