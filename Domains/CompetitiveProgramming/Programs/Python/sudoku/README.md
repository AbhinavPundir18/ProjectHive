# ðŸ§© Sudoku Solver (MAC-3 + MRV + LCV)

This project implements an **AI-based Sudoku Solver** in Python using **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** techniques.  
It uses **MAC-3 (Maintaining Arc Consistency)** with **MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)** and **LCV (Least Constraining Value)** heuristics to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Solves standard **9x9 Sudoku puzzles**
- ðŸ§  Uses **MAC-3 algorithm** for maintaining arc consistency
- ðŸ”¢ Employs **MRV** heuristic for selecting the next variable to assign
- ðŸŽ¯ Implements **LCV** heuristic to choose the least constraining value
- ðŸ’¡ Automatically updates domains and propagates constraints efficiently
- ðŸ§¾ Well-structured, modular, and easy to modify or extend

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

### 1. **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**
Sudoku is modeled as a CSP where:
- **Variables** â†’ Each empty cell  
- **Domain** â†’ Possible numbers (1â€“9)  
- **Constraints** â†’ No duplicates in row, column, or 3Ã—3 box  

### 2. **MAC-3 (Maintaining Arc Consistency)**
Ensures every variableâ€™s domain remains consistent with its neighbors (peers).  
Whenever a cell is assigned, the algorithm **propagates constraints** to other cells.

### 3. **MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)**
Selects the **most constrained cell** (with the fewest possible values) first.

### 4. **LCV (Least Constraining Value)**
Chooses the value that **restricts the fewest choices** for neighboring cells.
