Problem: Trapping Rain Water
Platform: LeetCode
Problem Code: 42
Difficulty: Hard
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, 
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. 
In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

Approach:
1. Use two pointers â€” one from the left and one from the right.
2. Maintain two variables `leftMax` and `rightMax` to store the maximum height encountered so far from each side.
3. Move the pointer with the smaller height inward.
   - If the current height is less than the corresponding max, water can be trapped = max - height.
   - Otherwise, update the max height.
4. Continue until both pointers meet.
5. This approach eliminates the need for extra arrays and efficiently computes the trapped water.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
